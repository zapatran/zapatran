## Hi there 👋

I am Thor, a **Computer Science** and **Multimedia Engineer** focused on **Web Development**. I am currently based in **Barcelona**, even though I spent some time living in Canada, Vancouver.

I have trouble naming my hobbies because I’m lucky enough that my biggest passion is what I do every day: **coding**. That said, I also enjoy **reading** (about code, obviously), **traveling**, [**taking pictures**](<https://www.instagram.com/zapatran>) and **learning** about **home automation**.

Still want to get to know me better? These are a few facts about myself.

*   👨🏻‍🏫 I have taught at Ironhack for over 5 years, helping students kickstart their web dev career in just a few months.
*   👷🏻‍♂️ I have always been a business-oriented person, and have an extensive sales and managerial background.
*   🇪🇸 I collect flags — yes, like Sheldon Cooper, but no, I don’t have a show about it.
*   🎒 I am obsessed with backpacks, luggage and travel equipment in general.
